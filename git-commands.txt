For Flask-Journey 🚀  
By Sudesh Subedi – BSc CSIT | Backend Dev in Progress

🧱 0. One-time setup (First time only)
Run once when you first clone or start the project:
git init                # Only if starting from scratch
git remote add origin https://github.com/sudesh856/Flask-Journey.git

🧑‍💻 1. Before You Code (ALWAYS)
git pull                # Get latest changes from GitHub before working

💾 2. After You Finish a Task or Learn Something New
git status              # See what files changed
git add .               # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Day X: What you did/learned"

☁️ 3. Push to GitHub (FIRST TIME after commit)
git push --set-upstream origin main

☁️ After that, just:
git push

🧠 4. To View Your Progress History
git log --oneline       # See previous commits

🧼 5. If You Mess Up and Want to Undo Uncommitted Changes
git restore .           # Reverts all files to last commit

🧪 6. To Check What You Changed
git diff                # See line-by-line changes before committing

✅ Git Commit Message Examples:
- Day 1: Created hello world Flask app
- Day 2: Learned route handling and URL params
- Day 3: Added basic HTML using templates

🔁 Optional (To Reset Push Forcefully)
Only use if needed (be careful):
git push -f origin main



git add templates/index.html
git commit -m "Updated index.html with new changes"
git push
